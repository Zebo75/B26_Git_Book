 Covid news.
 White House press secretary Jen Psaki announced Tuesday that she had tested positive for COVID-19.

     In a statement posted to Twitter, Psaki said she had two "socially-distanced meetings" with Biden on Monday and said he is not considered a close contact by CDC guidance.

     Biden tested negative with a PCR test on Tuesday, she said.

     "Today, in preparation for travel to Europe, I took a PCR test this morning. That test came back positive, which means I will be adhering to CDC guidance and no longer be traveling on the President's trip to Europe," Psaki wrote on Twitter.
